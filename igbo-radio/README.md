# Igbo-Speech-Dataset (Source of Additional Sentences)
This is a project to include Igbo in the CommonVoice platform

### Contents

17,778 cleaned sentences.

They were generated by crawling the articles on the Igbo Radio website.

The sentences were further filtered based on the [validation rules for Igbo](https://github.com/common-voice/sentence-collector/blob/main/server/lib/validation/languages/ig.js)

Furthermore, the sentences that did not pass the validation are still documented here as `discarded.txt` as additional Igbo data for the future.
